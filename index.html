            Hi, I'm Jeff Carl, a third-year IT student at PUP-Taguig. While
            majoring in IT, my passion lies in graphic illustration and design.
            I enjoy translating ideas into visually appealing creations and am
            actively enhancing my coding skills. Currently, I serve as the
            Director for Creatives in the Computer Society. Excited about the
            limitless possibilities in IT, I'm open to exploration and eager to
            define my future career.

            A not-so-long letter for the Jeff in five years
          </p>
          <div class="goals-letter">
            <p class="dear-jeff">
              In the coming five years, I envision myself working in the IT
              industry, specializing predominantly in front-end development(not
              evident in this exercise. i apologize). I believe my strengths lie
              in conceptualizing designs and translating them into various
              platforms such as systems, websites, and applications. My
              immediate plan is to use my academic background in the industry to
              secure a position post-graduation. And as I accumulate experience
              and financial stability within the field, I aspire to pursue my
              creative passion specifically Visual Development. My goal is to
              become a Visual Developer, a creator who breathes life into
              characters with distinct personalities, stories, and unique
              appearances. This imaginative process, which I often engage in
              when my focus drifts away during lessons, involves building homes
              and environments that align with their aesthetic. Despite my
              current limitation of not being able to draw them, I foresee a
              future where these characters and stories manifest in games or
              films, freeing them from my mind. This is my goal in terms of my
              career.
            </p>

            <p class="dear-jeff">
              On a personal note, I am committed to prioritizing my health,
              acknowledging a decline in both mental and physical well-being
              over the past few years. I aim to redefine what it means to be a
              healthy person (wow), paying careful attention to various aspects
              of my well-being. In alignment with my creative pursuits, my goal
              is also to join art conventions. Not only as an admirer but as a
              contributor, sharing and selling my artwork within the community.
              Furthermore, I am keen on joining creative movements that allow me
              to utilize my artistic skills for meaningful and impactful
              projects.
            </p>

            <p class="dear-jeff">
              In terms of relationships, I aspire to show greater affection
              towards my loved ones, particularly my parents, and improve my
              communication with them. I simply want my loved ones to feel the
              love they give me by showing them, and I've been longing for a
              deeper and more open line of communication with them for a while
              now. This extends to my friends, where I aim to reciprocate the
              positive energy they bring into our interactions.
            </p>

            <p class="dear-jeff">
              While acknowledging that change may be challenging, particularly
              for someone with earth signs dominating their astrological chart,
              I am committed to personal growth. No astrological alignment or
              mercury retrograde can ruin my improvements.
            </p>

            <p class="dear-jeff">
              To sum up this not-so-long letter for myself, (for you, Jeff) my
              overarching goal is to become the best version of myself. While
              this may sound cliché, it summarizes my enduring desire to
              overcome fears, address shortcomings, and continually strive for
              improvement. Do you still remember the letter I put inside my very
              first pen that I used for making digital art? I think this is also
              the best time to read them. I hope this letter finds you well and
              I hope you do well in life, future Jeff.
            </p>

            <p class="last">That is all for now. Thank you!</p>
